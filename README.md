# VBA of Wall Street: Stock Data Analysis

## Project background: Performing analysis on various stock data to determine annual performance 

### In this project we used VBA scripts that will allow Steve to run quick analysis in his stock data workbook to determine overall performance of said stocks over the last few years. With this analysis he will be able to make educated investment suggestions to his parents.

## Results
- We can conclude that the sample stocks had better annual performance in 2017 as opposed to 2018 with all but one stock having a positive return in 2017 vs only 2 stocks with positive return in 2018
